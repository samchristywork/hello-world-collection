## Overview

This repository holds various "Hello, World!" programs in multiple languages.
Each directory in this repository contains a self-contained program with
instructions for compiling and running it, along with a list of dependencies.
This repository will have a lot of "trivial" examples, but I also plan to add
more complicated examples like kernel modules, web frameworks, etc...

## Future Work

repository.
