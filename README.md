## Overview

This is a collection of "Hello, World!" programs written in various languages.
Each directory in this repository contains a self-contained program with
instructions for how to compile and run it, along with a list of dependencies.
This repository will have a lot of "trivial" examples, but I plan to also add
more complicated examples like kernel modules, web frameworks, etc...

## Future Work

Here is a short list of "Hello, World!" projects that I want to add to this
repository.

```
Gnuplot
Graphviz
Kernel Module
Operating System
Web Assembly
```
