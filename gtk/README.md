## Overview

This is the GTK version of "Hello, World!". It can be built with `make`.

This version is more complicated than most traditional "Hello, World!"
applications because I wanted to show widget interactions and drawing to the
GTK drawing area widget. When run, a button will be displayed that increments a
counter.
